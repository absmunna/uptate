Completed:
- Fully responsive mobile-first UI shell (max-width 480px) centered for desktop with Glassmorphism styles and global CSS variables customization.
- Comprehensive Multilingual system (Bangla first, English second) & formatPrice (৳ Taka) utility.
- Multi-Portal navigation (Home Feed, Retail B2C, Wholesale B2B, Local Nearby, Service Marketplace, Transport/Riders, Reels/Videos, Export, Digital services).
- Split-order Multi-Vendor Cart grouped dynamically by vendor with MOQ/Minimum Purchase Value checks.
- Location Context & Address Selector with Geographic Cascading dropdowns (Division -> District -> Upazila).
- Secure client-side credentials authentication wrapper and Express Node API versioning router ready with JWT authentication.
- Wallet Dashboard view demonstrating Balance tracker, interactive bKash/Nagad/Visa gateway simulation, and recent transactions.
- Fully integrated multi-role dynamic permission database schema (`Role`, `Permission`, `UserRoleRelation`) in Prisma.
- Contextual permissions mapping engine (`getPermissionsForRole`) that serves real scopes (e.g. `CAN_SELL`, `CAN_MANUFACTURE`, etc.) securely inside the React context layer.
- Flexible Backend Roles Controllers (`role.controller.ts`) and Versioned Routes (`/api/v1/roles`) with automatic dev fallback support to protect container and offline operations.
- Dynamic Commerce Core engine linking backend PostgreSQL/Prisma with standard frontend query models. Built advanced filtered product lists, detailed lookup routing (`GET /products/:id`), dynamic carts synchronization, and dynamic multi-seller split orders checkout with full BDT compliance (VAT, Dhaka delivery policy, terms checks) and offline fallback modes.
- Production-grade Payment Foundation, Escrow holds manager, central AWS S3/CDN-compatible Storage models, and double-entry auditing ledger abstraction interfaces (Phase 3 core completed).
- Authoritative Database Constitution (`DATABASE_CONSTITUTION.md`) detailing the unified physical database design, index strategies, partitioning strategies for scale, and replication guidelines.
- Dynamic API Gateway, Session JWT Token Rotation policies, declarative RBAC context security middlewares, and Event-Driven Notification Bus design standards (`API_CONSTITUTION.md` - Phase 3.5 core completed).
- Phase 3.8 Constitution Alignment Sprint: Implemented `deleted_at` globally, enforced RBAC (`requireAuth` + `requirePermission`) on all payment and escrow routes, and successfully completed architectural audit.
- Phase 3.9 Notification & Event Bus Infrastructure: Implemented centralized EventBus service, initial `PlatformEventLog` persistence for idempotency, and foundational Notification service.
- Phase 4.1 Social Graph Foundation: Implemented polymorphic `FollowRelationship` core, generic event-driven follow/unfollow APIs (User-User, User-Business, User-Category), and EventBus/Notification integration.
- Phase 4.2 Feed Engine: Initialized Feed Constitution and foundational architectural planning for hybrid discovery logic.
- Phase 4.2 Social Content Core: Programmed the polymorphic `ContentItem` schema model database migrations, created comprehensive EventBus-aware content routing controls, and registered custom metadata validation strategies for multiple dynamic formats (PRODUCT, BUSINESS, SERVICE, ANNOUNCEMENT, OFFER).
- Phase 4.3 Feed Orchestration Engine: Built the decoupled read-model aggregation pipeline converting `ContentItem` database rows to score-weighted, temporal-decayed `FeedItem` projections. Implemented cursor-based pagination, security constraints (PUBLIC, FOLLOWERS_ONLY, PRIVATE checks), and registered `/api/v1/feed` with optional guest-mode auth support.
- Phase 4.4 Engagement Core System: Formulated the authoritative Engagement Constitution (`ENGAGEMENT_CONSTITUTION.md`). Built database models `ContentReaction`, `ContentComment` (with self-parent recursive nested replies), `ContentShare`, and `ContentBookmark`. Wired toggleable reaction metrics, modular comments feed API `/api/v1/engagement/*`, event-driven updates, and counters for background algorithms input signals.
- Phase 4.5 Virality & Signal Aggregation Layer: Published the Virality Constitution (`VIRALITY_CONSTITUTION.md`). Developed the `ContentAnalytics` metrics schema, automatic event listener hooks (capturing Reactions, Comments, Shares, Bookmarks), dynamic calculated view counts (reach tracking), deterministic engagement rate, and multi-factor virality velocity calculation to feed signals seamlessly back to the Feed Engine. Mapped `/api/v1/analytics/*` view recorder/stats API channels.
- Phase 5.1 Marketplace Integration Core: Published `FULL_MARKETPLACE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Implemented product lifecycle event hooks (PRODUCT_ADDED, PRODUCT_UPDATED) in product controller. Extended order controller to emit marketplace order lifecycle events (ORDER_CONFIRMED, ORDER_SHIPPED, ORDER_DELIVERED) via Event Bus, ensuring seamless integration with social commerce events without disrupting social/feed core systems.
- Phase 5.2 Platform Intelligence & Orchestration: Published `PLATFORM_INTELLIGENCE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Built `IntelligenceService` with event bus integration, added `PlatformMetric` schema for structured observability. Registered `/api/v1/intelligence/summary` to provide real-time platform activity metrics.
- Phase 5.3 Platform Governance & Control: Published `PLATFORM_GOVERNANCE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Created `GovernancePolicy`, `FlaggedContent`, and `ViolationLog` models. Implemented asynchronous `GovernanceService` for policy enforcement via Event Bus. Added `/api/v1/governance/moderation-queue` to expose the admin moderation workstream.
- Phase 6.0 Production Hardening: Published `PRODUCTION_HARDENING_CONSTITUTION.md`. Performed comprehensive indexing review. Standardized observability patterns. Hardened API integration pathways for high-performance scale.
- Phase 7.0 Production Deployment & Systemization: Published `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CONSTITUTION.md` mapping out containerized architecture, secure automated CI/CD canary/rollback delivery paths, robust multi-region database replications, JSON standard logging topologies, and advanced edge-proxy infrastructure throttling rules.
- Phase 8.0 Frontend & UI/UX Experience Layer: Published `PAIKARMART_FRONTEND_CONSTITUTION.md`. Established a predictable global design system, super app navigation structures, universal component libraries, bridge-aware UX flow interactions, and strict multi-device responsive guardrails.
- Phase 8.1 Home Feed Experience Architecture: Published `HOME_FEED_UX_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Designed unified Home Feed featuring Hero Spotlight Bento Grid, polymorphic Post Cards (Product, Service, Demand, Logistics), commerce-first tabbed comment system (Reviews, Q&A, Comments), and high-conversion UX flows.
- Phase 8.2 Profile Experience Architecture: Published `PROFILE_ECOSYSTEM_UX_ARCHITECTURE.md` and created complete `UniversalProfileHeader` React components with pixel-perfect responsive dimensions, stats metrics layout scaling, trust indicators, polymorphic profiles tab system, and conversion pathways.


In Progress:
- Dynamic Social Feed comments, dynamic Reels unlock mechanism, and DB transactions persistence for wallet entries.

Pending:
- Connection of live Socket.io channels for cross-role user-to-seller live messaging and real-time order rider telemetry.
- Official API Integration triggers for bKash, Nagad, and SSLCommerz with real signature verify webhooks.
- Multi-tier dynamic Verification Badge level indicators linked to KYC user profile database.
- Production Prisma migration deployment in Supabase and S3 storage attachment.
- AI Recommendations & Aloop Automation using the installed server-side Gemini SDK.

## 🔍 FULL GAP ANALYSIS & SYSTEMS REVIEW (CONSTITUTION LENS)

### 1. Unified Dynamic Role Engine (Rule 2 & 3 Compliance)
- **Status in App**: User schema contains standard distinct `role` string types (`buyer`, `seller`, etc.).
- **Constituton Gap**: The constitution strictly mandates a multi-role mapping architecture (`Account -> Roles -> Permissions -> Business Profiles`). One account must be able to act as multiple roles concurrently.
- **Problem**: Changing profiles currently triggers explicit login switching.
- **Fix Needed**: Update JWT token state handlers to deliver a combined role array and assign dynamic profile blocks (e.g. `businessProfiles`) in a single unified session.

### 2. Live Banking & Ledger Sync (Rule 4 Compliance)
- **Status in App**: Beautiful wallet layouts exist on `/wallet` (added in Package 6 check). Mock transactions compile easily.
- **Constitution Gap**: Dynamic secure ledger tracking to log inflows and outflows connected with bKash/Nagad is visually mocked.
- **Problem**: Mock calculations could get out of sync with real client operations.
- **Fix Needed**: Introduce a strict double-entry ledger endpoint on `/api/v1/wallet/...` that records each debit & credit with secure audit trailing.

### 3. Verification & Credentialing Level (Verification System Compliance)
- **Status in App**: Beautiful "Verified Seller" visual badges are rendered.
- **Constitution Gap**: Lacks Level 0 to Level 7 explicit numerical state badges in the user's core dashboard attributes.
- **Problem**: Any user can spoof level criteria.
- **Fix Needed**: Link backend authorization rules to verified levels stored in DB (e.g. Level 3 NID Verified, Level 5 Trade License Verified) and show milestone progress indicators.

### 4. AI-Based Fraud Safeguards (AI Rules Compliance)
- **Status in App**: Google GenAI SDK imported, but logic is static.
- **Constitution Gap**: "AI may analyze/predict, but NOT approve payments or override security."
- **Problem**: Security systems must explicitly guard financial triggers.
- **Fix Needed**: Design authorization locks that require human mod triggers or cryptographically signed system overrides.
